# ELVA-Embedded-Language-Model-and-Virtual-Assistant
An Embedded Virtual Assistant implemented on esp32 as an assignment for Embedded Systems Design and Analysis course at the University of Guilan, Department of Computer Engineering, presented in Fall 2024.


# System Overview
Elva is an embedded virtual assistant powered by a language model (basically a talking robot! :D). This project aims to develop a small embedded system capable of listening, processing, and responding to human speech, functioning as a smart virtual assistant. Various techniques and technologies were utilized to build this system, including C and Python programming, pre-trained language models, text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) models, as well as IoT and microcontroller integration.
